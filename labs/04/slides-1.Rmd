# Lab 4: Flights
### Introduction to Probability and Statistics

---
## Agenda

--

1. Introduction to the flights dataset
  
--

2. Part I: Understanding the Context and Structure of the Data
    - Unit of observation, types of variables, unit of measures, patterns
    
--

3. Review logical operators and filtering

--

# Part I: Understanding the Context and Structure of the Data

---

##Lab Part I

1. What is the unit of observation in the data frame on the handout?

2. Which variables are categorical? Which variables are numerical? Do any of the variable have ambiguous data types to you?

3. Is there any discernible pattern to the manner in which the rows are ordered?

4. What is your guess for the units/format used to record the departure time?

5. What filter would you use to extract the flights that left in the springtime?


.task[
In pairs, please discuss the questions above.
]

```{r}
countdown::countdown(6, font_size = "2em")

# Logic operators and filtering

---

##Evaluating equivalence

--

```{r vege, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
"fruit" == "vegetable"
```
--
```{r ref.label = "vege", echo = FALSE}
```
--
```{r fruit, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
"fruit" == "fruit"
```
--
```{r ref.label = "fruit", echo = FALSE}
```
--
```{r notfruit, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
"fruit" != "fruit"
```
--
```{r ref.label = "notfruit", echo = FALSE}
```

--

.task[
== evaluates equality, != evaluates inequality.
]

---

##Filtering rows

`Filtering` is the act of reducing the rows of a data frame to those that meet certain criteria.

```{css, echo = FALSE}
.huge .remark-code { /*Change made here*/
  font-size: 150% !important;
}
```

.huge[
```
filter(<DATAFRAME>, <LOGICAL VECTOR>)
```
]

# Part II: Computing with the Data

---

## Loading Flights Data

Load the flights data from the stat20data package.

```{r echo = TRUE}
library(stat20data)
data(flights)
```

---

## One verb commands


1. **filter()**: Filter the data set to contain only the flights that went to Portland, Oregon and print the first few rows of the data frame. How many were there in 2020?

2. **mutate()**: Mutate a new variable called `avg_speed` that is the average speed of the plane during the flight, measured in miles per hour. (Look through the column names or the help file to find variables that can be used to calculate this.)



```{r}
countdown::countdown(3, font_size = "2em")
```

---

## One verb commands

3. **arrange()**: Arrange the data set to figure out: which flight holds the record for longest departure delay (in hrs) and what was its destination? What was the destination and delay time (in hrs) for the flight that was least delayed, i.e. that left the most ahead of schedule?

4. **summarize()**: Confirm the records for departure delay from the question above by summarizing that variable by its maximum and its minimum value.


```{r}
countdown::countdown(3,font_size = "2em")
```
